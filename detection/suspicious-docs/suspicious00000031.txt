As of my last update in April 2023, Joe Biden is the President of the United States. However, please note that information may change over time and I may not always have access to real-time updates.

If you're looking for more up-to-date information or want to confirm the current president, I suggest checking official government websites such as whitehouse.gov or reputable news sources like The New York Times, CNN, or BBC News.
