Evolution is the scientifically supported theory that explains how species change over time through a process of variation, mutation, genetic drift, and natural selection. Here's a simplified explanation:

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Variation**: All individuals in a population exhibit some degree of variation in their traits, such as height, eye color, or beak shape.
2. **Heritability**: These variations are inherited from one generation to the next through genes and other mechanisms.
3. **Adaptation**: Individuals with certain traits that help them survive and reproduce better than others in a specific environment will have a higher chance of passing those traits on to their offspring.
4. **Natural Selection**: The process by which individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass those traits on to the next generation.

**The Process:**

1. **Genetic Variation**: Mutations (random changes in DNA) or genetic recombination during reproduction introduce new variations into a population.
2. **Selection Pressures**: Environmental factors such as climate change, predation, or competition for resources exert selective pressures that favor certain traits over others.
3. **Survival and Reproduction**: Individuals with beneficial traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits on to their offspring.
4. **Inheritance**: The next generation inherits the accumulated traits from previous generations, including both the beneficial and detrimental ones.
5. **Speciation**: Over time, populations may become reproductively isolated, leading to the formation of new species.

**Mechanisms:**

1. **Mutation**: Random genetic changes that can be beneficial or detrimental.
2. **Genetic Drift**: The random loss of genes due to chance events, such as population bottlenecks.
3. **Gene Flow**: The transfer of genes between populations through migration or interbreeding.
4. **Natural Selection**: As mentioned earlier, the process by which individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.

**Example:**

Consider a population of birds living in an area with increasingly dry seasons. Birds with stronger beaks (trait) will be better able to crack open seeds during droughts, while those with weaker beaks may struggle to find food and die off. Over time, the population adapts by favoring individuals with stronger beaks, which are more likely to survive and reproduce.

**Timeline:**

Evolution is a slow process that occurs over many generations. It's estimated to take:

* **Millions of years**: For species to diverge significantly.
* **Thousands of generations**: For populations to adapt to changing environments.
* **Individuals or a few hundred generations**: For small-scale changes in populations.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. Evolution is a gradual process that shapes the diversity of life on Earth.
2. Variation, mutation, and natural selection are essential mechanisms driving evolution.
3. Adaptation occurs over time as populations respond to changing environments.
4. Speciation can result from isolation or other factors.
