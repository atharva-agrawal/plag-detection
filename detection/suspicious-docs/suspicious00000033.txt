There is some debate among geographers and cartographers about how to define a continent, but the most widely accepted classification recognizes 7 continents:

1. Africa
2. Antarctica
3. Asia
4. Australia (or Oceania)
5. Europe
6. North America
7. South America

Some people also consider Europe and Asia as one large continent called Eurasia, or combine North and South America into a single continent called the Americas. However, the 7-continent model is the most widely accepted classification.

It's worth noting that the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) defines a continent as "a major continuous area of land, usually separated by oceanic water". By this definition, Europe and Asia are considered separate continents.

How about you? Which continent do you think has the most fascinating cultures or landscapes?
