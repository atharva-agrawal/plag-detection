Constitutional rights, also known as fundamental rights or individual rights, are the essential freedoms and guarantees that are protected by a country's constitution. These rights are considered inherent to all citizens and are designed to promote democracy, equality, justice, and human dignity.

In general, constitutional rights can be grouped into several categories:

1. **Civil Rights**: Protect individuals from government overreach and ensure their basic freedoms, such as:
	* Freedom of speech and expression
	* Right to assemble and associate
	* Right to a fair trial and due process
	* Protection against unreasonable searches and seizures
2. **Human Rights**: Ensure the dignity and well-being of all individuals, including:
	* Right to life and personal liberty
	* Protection from torture and cruel treatment
	* Freedom from slavery and servitude
3. **Social and Economic Rights**: Address the basic needs of citizens, such as:
	* Right to education
	* Right to healthcare
	* Right to fair wages and working conditions
4. **Political Rights**: Enable citizens to participate in governance and hold their leaders accountable, including:
	* Right to vote and participate in elections
	* Right to free expression and speech in public affairs

Constitutional rights are typically enshrined in a country's supreme law document (e.g., the US Constitution) or through constitutional amendments. They can also be established through international agreements, such as human rights treaties.

Key characteristics of constitutional rights include:

1. **Universality**: All citizens have equal access to these rights.
2. **Non-discrimination**: Rights are protected from discriminatory treatment based on factors like age, sex, nationality, or disability.
3. **Indivisibility**: Each right is interconnected and interdependent with others.
4. **Supremacy**: Constitutional rights take precedence over ordinary laws and regulations.

In summary, constitutional rights provide the foundation for a democratic society by safeguarding individual freedoms, dignity, and basic needs, ensuring that all citizens are treated equally and justly under the law.
