The national animal of India is the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). It was officially declared as the national animal in 1973. However, it's worth noting that in 2010, the government of India also declared the Indian peafowl and the elephant as national birds and animals respectively, but they are not universally recognized as such.

The Bengal tiger is an iconic species that is native to the Indian subcontinent, and it plays a significant cultural and symbolic role in Indian society. It's considered an important part of India's natural heritage, and conservation efforts are underway to protect this majestic animal from extinction.
