The longest river in the world is the Nile River, which stretches for approximately 6,853 kilometers (4,258 miles) from its source in Burundi to its delta on the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt. The Nile flows through 11 countries, including Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and finally, Egypt.

However, it's worth noting that there is ongoing debate about whether the Nile or the Amazon River is actually the longest river in the world. While the Nile is generally considered to be the longest, the Amazon River has a longer total length of waterways, including its tributaries. But if you only consider the main stem of the river (the part that flows directly from its source to its mouth), the Nile takes the title.

Here's a comparison:

* Nile River: 6,853 km (4,258 miles)
* Amazon River: 7,062 km (4,400 miles) - but this includes many tributaries and branches
* Amazon's main stem: around 6,000-6,300 km (3,700-3,900 miles)

So, while the debate continues, the Nile is widely considered to be the longest river in the world.
