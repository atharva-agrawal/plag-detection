Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of organic compounds, such as glucose. This process is essential for life on Earth, as it provides energy and organic compounds for plants to grow and develop, and also produces oxygen as a byproduct, which is released into the atmosphere.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how photosynthesis works:

**The Light-Dependent Reactions**

1. **Light absorption**: Chlorophyll, a green pigment found in plant cells, absorbs light energy from the sun.
2. **Excitation of electrons**: The absorbed light energy excites electrons in the chlorophyll molecule, which are then transferred to other molecules.
3. **Formation of ATP and NADPH**: The excited electrons generate a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, leading to the formation of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).

**The Light-Independent Reactions**

1. **Carbon fixation**: CO2 (carbon dioxide) is absorbed from the atmosphere through small openings on plant leaves called stomata.
2. **Calvin cycle**: The CO2 is fixed into a 3-carbon molecule called 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA), using ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions.
3. **Reduction of PGA**: PGA is reduced to form glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), releasing oxygen as a byproduct.

**The Final Steps**

1. **Regeneration of RuBP**: The enzyme RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) binds CO2 and regenerates the RuBP molecule.
2. **Synthesis of glucose**: G3P molecules are used to synthesize glucose (C6H12O6), which is released into the plant cells for energy.

**Key Products**

1. **Glucose**: The primary product of photosynthesis, providing energy and building blocks for plant growth and development.
2. **Oxygen**: Released as a byproduct of photosynthesis, essential for the survival of most living organisms on Earth.

In summary, photosynthesis is a complex process that involves light-dependent reactions to generate ATP and NADPH, followed by light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) to convert CO2 into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct.
