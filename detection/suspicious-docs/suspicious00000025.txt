Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. These can be patents, trademarks, copyright, industrial designs and trade secrets. 

There are four main types of intellectual property:

1. **Patents**: protect new inventions or innovations, granting exclusive rights to the inventor for a certain period.
2. **Trademarks**: protect brand identities, such as logos, names, and slogans, distinguishing one company's goods or services from another's.
3. **Copyrights**: safeguard original literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as books, music, films, and software.
4. **Trade Secrets**: confidential information that provides a business with a competitive advantage, like recipes, formulas, or methods.

Intellectual property rights give creators and inventors control over their work and allow them to profit from it. These rights can be licensed, sold, or transferred to others.

Examples of intellectual property include:

- A company's logo
- A movie script
- A software program
- A new type of medicine
- A fashion design

Intellectual property is an essential component of modern business and innovation. It helps creators and inventors recoup their investments in research and development, protects their work from unauthorized use or copying, and encourages innovation.

There are several laws and regulations that govern intellectual property worldwide, including:

* The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)
* The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
* The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty

Overall, intellectual property is a crucial aspect of protecting creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship.
